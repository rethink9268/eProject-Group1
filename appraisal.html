        <h2>Watch Appraisals</h2>

        <p>
          Have you ever been curious about the value of your watch? Perhaps itâ€™s
          a gold pocket watch that has been passed down through your family for
          generations or a steel wristwatch that you bought from a second hand
          market. It is not always precious metals that define the value of a
          watch and an increase in market share of base metals have increased
          these material's value
        </p>
        <p>
          Our experts understand the value of watches which have been passed
          down as family heirlooms and are familiar with the worth of brands
          such as Rolex, Omega, Tag Heuer, Rado, Gucci, Casio and Seikos.
          However if you are looking to value your Kermit the Frog watch, we
          have specialists who can value these as well. Most collectors of
          watches look to value their collection as a whole, but we would advise
          on securing individual values.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'd like to get a Watch valuation from our online specialist,
          simply upload a photograph and tell us any other details you know
          about the item.
